# Introduction to SEM

## Overview of SEM

- Multivariate statistical analysis describing relationship between latent and observed variables.
- Extension of multiple regression analysis and factor analysis.
- Used in social science to test models where theoretical constructs such as attitudes, beliefs and values are measured directly through multiple items.
- Used in psychology, where latent variables such as personality traits or intelligence are measured through questionnaires.

## Benefits of SEM

- Used to model complex relationships with inter related variables.
- Provides estimates for direct and indirect effects.
- Ability to handle missing data and provide model parameter estimates in the presence of missing data.

## Limitations of SEM

- Large sample size to obtain reliable estimates of model parameters
- Requires a well specified theoretical model
- Difficult to learn, with familiarity of statistical software and advanced statistical concepts needed.

## Applications of SEM

- Psychology
- Social Sciences
- Education
- Business


## Introduction to lavaan

- R package for Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) analysis. 
- Lavaan stands for Latent Variable Analysis


# SEM Key Concepts

## Path diagrams and notation

- Graphical representations of the relationships between variables in a SEM model
- Observed variables are represented by squares or rectangles
- Latent variables are represented by circles or ovals.
- Arrows between variables represents hypothesized relationships between them either direct or bidirectional.

## Latent and Observed variables

- Observed variables are measured directly
- Latent variables are not directly measured and are inferred from observed variables.
- Latent variables are also known as observed or latent constructs.

## Endogenous and Exogenous variables
- Endogenous variables are variables  that are hypothesized to be caused by other variables in the model.
- Exogenous variables are not influenced by other variables in the model.
- In a path diagram, endogenous variables have arrows pointing to them while exogenous don't.

## Direct and Indirect Effects
- A direct effect is the direct relationship between two variables.
- An indirect effect is a relationship that is mediated by one or more other variables in the model.

# Lavaan Overview

## Installing and loading the package

To install the package
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("lavaan")
```
To load the package
```{r}
library(lavaan)
```



## Creating a model object

- Model object specifies relationship between observed and latent variables
```{r}
model <- 'y =~ x1 + x2'
```
- `~=` specify observed variables to latent variable relationship
- `~` specifies regression between outcome and predictor variables.
- `~~` specifies covariance between variables.

## Fitting the model

```{r, eval=FALSE}
fit <- sem(model, data = mydata)
```


## Extracting results from the model
```{r, eval=FALSE}
summary(fit, standardized = TRUE)
```


# Model Interpretation

## Interpreting parameter estimates and standard errors

- Parameter estimates are values of the coefficients calculated for each predictor variable in the model
- Standard errors are measure of uncertainty in the estimation of these coefficients.

## Interpreting fit indices and goodness-of-fit tests

- Fit indices and goodness-of-fit Measures the goodness-of-fit of the model
- Fit indices includes
  - Chi-square
  - Root Mean Square Error of Approximation(RMSEA)
  - Comparative Fit Index(CFI)
  - Tucker-Lewis Index(TLI)
  - Standardized Root Mean Square Residual(SRMR)
- Good model fit is indicated by a low chi-square, low RMSEA and high CFI.


## Interpreting residuals and modification indices

- Residuals are differences between the observed and predicted values.
- Modification indices are changes made to the model to improve interpreting residuals.
- High residuals indicate that the model is missing important indicator predictor variables or the model is not appropriate for the data.

# Case Study

## Political Democracy Dataset
The dataset contains various measures of political democracy and industrialization in developing countries.

## Variables

- Political Democracy in 1960
  * y1 - Expert ratings of the freedom of the press in 1960
  * y2 - The freedom of political opposition in 1960
  * y3 - The fairness of elections in 1960
  * y4 - The effectiveness of the elected legistlature in 1960
  
- Political Democracy in 1965
  * y5 - Expert ratings of the freedom of the press in 1965
  * y6 - The freedom of political opposition in 1965
  * y7 - The fairness of elections in 1965
  * y8 - The effectiveness of the elected legistlature in 1965
  
- Level of Industrialization in 1960
 * x1 - The gross national product (GNP) per capita in 1960
 * x2 - The inanimate energy consumption per captita in 1960
 * x3 - The percentage of the labour force in industry in 1960

# Summary

## Key takeaways
- Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a statistical technique used to analyze the relationships between observed and latent (unobserved) variables.
- Lavaan is an R package for SEM that allows users to specify their models using syntax that is similar to standard regression equations.
- When using lavaan, it's important to specify the model correctly, including specifying the relationships between the variables and the measurement model for the latent variables.
- Lavaan allows users to test the fit of their model using several fit indices, such as chi-square, RMSEA, CFI, and TLI. 
- When interpreting the results of a lavaan analysis, it's important to consider both the statistical significance of the estimates and their practical significance.
- Finally, SEM is a powerful tool that can help researchers better understand the complex relationships between variables, but it's important to use it appropriately and with caution.
