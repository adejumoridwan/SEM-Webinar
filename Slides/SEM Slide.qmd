# Introduction to SEM

## Overview of SEM

- Describes relationship between latent and observed variables by testing complex theoretical models.
- Extension of multiple regression analysis and factor analysis.
- Used in social science to test models where theoretical constructs such as attitudes, beliefs and values are measured directly through multiple items.
- Used in psychology, where latent variables such as personality traits or intelligence are measured through questionnaires.

## Benefits of SEM

- Used to model complex relationships with inter related variables.
- Provides estimates for direct and indirect effects.
- Ability to handle missing data and provide model parameter estimates in the presence of missing data.

## Limitations of SEM

- Large sample size to obtain reliable estimates of model parameters
- Requires a well specified theoretical model
- Difficult to learn, with familiarity of statistical software and advanced statistical concepts needed.

## Applications of SEM

- Psychology
- Social Sciences
- Education
- Business


## Introduction to lavaan

R package for Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) analysis. 


# SEM Key Concepts

## Path diagrams and notation

- Graphical representations of the relationships between variables in a SEM model
- Observed variables are represented by squares or rectangles
- Latent variables are represented by circles or ovals.
- Arrows between variables represents hypothesized relationships between them either direct or bidirectional.

## Latent and Observed variables

- Observed variables are measured directly
- Latent variables are not directly measured and are inferred from observed variables.
- Latent variables are also known as observed or latent constructs.

## Endogenous and Exogenous variables
- Endogenous variables are variables  that are hypothesized to be caused by other variables in the model.
- Exogenous variables are not influenced by other variables in the model.
- In a path diagram, endogenous variables have arrows pointing to them while exogenous don't.

## Direct and Indirect Effects
- A direct effect is the direct relationship between two variables.
- An indirect effect is a relationship that is mediated by one or more other variables in the model.
